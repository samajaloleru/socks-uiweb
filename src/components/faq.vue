Please ensure you are signed into DTCoop using your main mobile device, and also keep your data on while using the app in order for us to determine the best possible loan offer for you.Another possible reason is that you may not have shared all of the information required in the application or provided invalid details. However, there can be other reasons. As a responsible lender, we take steps to ensure we only extend credit to applicants who can afford it, so that our clients wonâ€™t become too indebted. It is possible that at this time, you donâ€™t match the profile of individual we normally lend money to. Negative repayment patterns on previous obligations (including DTCoop loans) can also limit access to credit, or make it more expensive to obtain.Whatever the situation, we recommend keeping your app installed and using it to perform other transactions, as this boosts your eligibility for loans."
